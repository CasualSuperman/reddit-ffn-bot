# Fanfiction Data Bot for Reddit
# **THE GOAL**
Lately, I've seen everyone likes to link fics. Though, that can be tedious, especially if you are on mobile. You have to _go_ to fanfiction.net, and then you have to _copy_ the link, _hyperlink_ it, and then _format_ the description. This bot aims to simplify it all - all you'll have to type is...
