# Fanfiction Data Bot for Reddit
# **THE GOAL**
Lately, I've seen everyone likes to link fics. Though, that can be tedious, especially if you are on mobile. You have to _go_ to fanfiction.net, and then you have to _copy_ the link, _hyperlink_ it, and then _format_ the description. This bot aims to simplify it all - all you'll have to type is...

I recommend this method.

# **USAGE AND OUTPUT**
_(Temporary Note: Results can take time - up to an hour, until this bot has enough comment karma.)_

###**USAGE, TIPS, AND TRICKS**

**To link Harry Potter and the Natural 20:**
```
linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20)
```

**You can use the author name** in the link request for more accuracy. This is *especially* helpful if your requested fic has a generic name, as follows:
```
linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black)
```

> [***Emperor***](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor) by [*Marquis Black*](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1227033/Marquis-Black)

**You can use direct links** - they will also work, and rather accurately:

```
linkffn(https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magics-of-the-Arcane)
```

###**WHAT YOU CAN'T DO** _(yet)_
- You can't link from OP.
- You can't use linkdlp or linkao3, since they aren't implemented.
- You can't change or format the code phrase (eg. Linkffn(...) or _linkffn_(...) won't work)

###**UPCOMING FEATURES**
- Support for DLP forums
- Support for AO3
- More at request

###**BUGS**
- Sometimes the description (word count, etc) doesn't display, but I'm not sure why.
