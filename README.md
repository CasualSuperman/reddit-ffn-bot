#Fanfiction Data Bot for Reddit

#**THE GOAL**

Lately, I've seen everyone likes to link fics. Though, that can be tedious, especially if you are on mobile. You have to *go* to fanfiction.net, and then you have to *copy* the link, *hyperlink* it, and then *format* the description. This bot aims to simplify it all - all you'll have to type is

    linkffn(Dagger and Rose)

to link Dagger and Rose.

To have more accurate results, if you remember the author, you can do

    linkffn(The Denarian Lord by Shezza)

I recommend this method.

#**USAGE AND OUTPUT**
Results can take time - up to an hour, until this bot is approved.

Output for

    linkffn(Magics of the Arcane)

will look like this:
> [**Magics of the Arcane** by Eilyfe](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magics-of-the-Arcane)
> > *Sometimes, all it takes for a man to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Amid giants, there is no choice but become one yourself. If you want to keep on living, that is. [GoF, Mentor!Albus]*

You can namedrop multiple fics in the same comment, with something like this:

    One of my favorite fics is the Denarian Series by Shezza. It starts with The Denarian Renegade (linkffn(The Denarian Renegade)), continues with The Denarian Knight - linkffn(The Denarian Knight), and ends with The Denarian Lord.

    linkffn(The Denarian Lord by Shezza)

And still expect it to work, as follows. ***JUST MAKE SURE YOUR PARENTHESES MATCH UP!*** (eg. as in The Denarian Renegade above.)

Sometimes the description screws up, but I'm not sure why... yet.


#**FUTURE UPDATES**
Once I have the basics outlined, I'll start adding in more providers, such as AO3 and DLP. For these, the commands will be

    linkao3(D.S.S. Requirement)

or

    linkdlp(Santi Boy Who Lived)
